# GitHub Users App

## Overview

Jetpack Compose for UI, Paging 3 for efficient data loading, Clean Architecture principles, Hilt for
dependency injection, and KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) for annotation processing.

- Paginated list with efficient loading using `PagingData`
- User details with fallback to local cache
- Network status tracking with automatic retry on reconnection
- Clean Architecture (Domain, Data, App layers)
- Dependency Injection with Hilt
- Modular, testable, and scalable codebase
